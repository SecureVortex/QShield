# QShield: Quantum-Resistant Real-Time Intrusion Detection and Response System

## Overview

QShield is the world's first open-source, quantum-inspired cybersecurity framework that combines quantum entropy, quantum machine learning, and post-quantum cryptography to detect and respond to quantum-enabled cyber threats in real time.

## Features

- Quantum entropy key/session token generation
- Quantum-inspired anomaly detection
- Automated quantum-aware incident response
- Quantum attack simulation (Shor’s, Grover’s)
- Adaptive post-quantum cryptography integration
- Real-time dashboard & API

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the API: `uvicorn api.main:app --reload`
4. Explore the dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard/app.py`
